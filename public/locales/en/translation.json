    "briefcase": "I did a “preparatory class” after high school (a demanding two-year program to prepare the entry exams to France’s top business schools) and was admitted into <a href='http://www.audencia.com/en/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Audencia</a>. After completing the general curriculum I did an internship in a French “<a href='https://beta.gouv.fr/en/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>State startup</a>”. It was there that I discovered web development, fell in love with it, and decided to become a developer.",
    "code": "I started learning how to code on my own in the summer of 2017, then applied to <a href='https://simplon.co/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Simplon</a>, a state and EU funded school / social startup. I attended their seven-month web development program (fullstack PHP/JavaScript), then did a two-month internship as a web developer at the startup <a href='https://brothertongue.com/#/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Brother Tongue</a>.",
    "heart": "I love roller skating, reading books–especially in English, Spanish and Portuguese, crafting things and discussing social matters (from feminism to social inclusion to education). I look forward to learning new skills, discovering more places and people, and finding my dream job, part software engineer, part project manager.",
